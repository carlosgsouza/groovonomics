I would like to express my deepest apprectiation to my mentor, Prof. Eduardo Figueiredo, whose wisdom guided me through the difficult process of becoming a Master. He always set me in the correct path when I was lost and he believed in me until the end, even when I did not believe myself. Furthermore, I would like to thank Prof. Stefan Hanenberg, for the valuable contributions to the statistical analysis.

I am greateful to my family and friends, who were supportive and patient, and never let me go. To my parents who raised me with all the love in the world and made me the man I am today. In special, to my mother, who watched me work all night so many times and always comforted me with sweet words and a hot cup of coffee.

Finally, I would like to thank my beautiful wife, Angelica. You were always there for me. You are my angel.
