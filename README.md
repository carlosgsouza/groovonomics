groovonomics
============

groovonomics is my master project at UFMG. It aims to understand the economics behind the usage of typing systems in groovy. 

This project includes a set of scripts to perform the following tasks
* Fetch data from GitHub (source code, project metadata, issues, users, etc)
* Analyze Groovy code statically
* Manage my execution platform in AWS

There is almost no documentation apart from my unit tests in this project. However, if you are interested in this project, please contact me and I will be happy to help you out.

The name groovonomics is based on the great book [Freakonomics](http://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378522562&sr=8-1&keywords=freakonomics) by Levitt and Dubner.
